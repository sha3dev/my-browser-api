## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a Notion integration or API token?

No. Simply provide a public Notion page link, and we'll automatically convert it to email.

### Does my Notion page have to be public?

Yes, pages must be public for access. However, you can keep them unlisted by disabling the 'Allow search engines' option in Notion.

### Can I schedule recurring emails?

Yes. Set your desired schedule once, and we'll automatically send updated content from your Notion page.

### Can I trigger emails manually?

Absolutely. Each setup includes a unique webhook URL for manual triggers via Zapier, Make, your backend, or Notion webhooks.

### Which email clients are supported?

We support Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and all major email clients on desktop and mobile, fully optimized for dark mode.

### Is there a free trial?

Yes, enjoy all features free for 14 days — cancel anytime.

### What type of content works best?

Ideal for newsletters, internal updates, meeting recaps, release notes, and any regular updates managed within Notion.

### Can I send sensitive content?

Not recommended. Your Notion pages must be public (even if unlisted), meaning sensitive or confidential content isn't advisable.

### How many emails can I send per month?

There’s no fixed limit—you can convert and send as many emails as you like. To keep the service fair, delivery priority adjusts dynamically based on volume, so very high senders may experience slightly lower priority, ensuring the best possible experience for everyone.

### Can I use Notion to Email for mass email campaigns or newsletters?

Notion to Email is optimized for internal communications, team updates, reports, and similar targeted content, with a recommended limit of up to 50 recipients per email. For mass email campaigns or newsletters targeting larger audiences, we recommend using specialized email marketing platforms designed specifically for those needs.
